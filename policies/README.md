# CyberGIS Cloud Policies

CyberGIS Cloud requires a lot of AWS permissions to run. It is important that we keep these permissions minimal to build up trust and security. 'PC-BasePolicy.json' is based on the [base AWS ParallelCluster pcluster user policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3.html). 'PC-HeadPolicy.json' is based on the [head node IAM role additional policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3.html#iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3-example-user-policies). 'PC-ExtraPolicy.json' contains additional IAM permissions that are needed for the ParallelCluster CloudFormation custom resource. Please note that these policies only currently account for the permissions needed to start the ParallelCluster custom resource. Additional IAM permissions are likely needed to create the network and storage resources.
